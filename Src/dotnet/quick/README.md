Generate library.cs from xsd

cd to working quick project directory

xsd ..\..\java\quick\schema\v1.4\quick.xsd /classes /n:r1.elm.hl7.org /o:./generated


Update:  Installed Xsd2Code 2015+ VS plugin.  It is a free maintained plugin from the older xsd2code 3.4.  

Strange after all these years of xsd that MS xsd.exe hasn't added any features.
